## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Estimated time

6 hours

### Actual time

4 hours

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS animation
- Flexbox
- API requests (fetch)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue framework
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs-dev.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=ru&_x_tr_hl=ru&_x_tr_pto=sc)

### What I learned

- I learned about VUE lifecycle and some VUE lifecycle's hooks
- I finally tried basics CSS animations
- I gained some more experience with map APIs

### Continued development

In future projects I want to focus on some smooth CSS and GSAP+VUE animations because I am not completely comfortable with them right now. Also I am looking forward to create something more complicated on VUE (for example, mini games).

### Useful resources

To build this little web app I used following APIs:

- [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) - This helped me with getting location from IP
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) - This API helped me with rendering the map.
- [Mapbox VUE 3](https://vue-mapbox-gl.studiometa.dev/) - This small library of VUE 3 components for mapbox helped me a lot since Mapbox doesn't have any solutions for VUE.
